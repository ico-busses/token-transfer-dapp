The Dapp loads up the Token details from the token Address you provide. It handles Decimal calulations in the background.
All you need is the Token address.  
 
    * Presently, it only works with Metamask. If we receive enough requests, we would add support for other wallet types

#### Usage  
- Get the address of the token you wish to interact with
- Login to Metamask and load up the Dapp
- Put the adddress in the `contract address` input field on the Dapp
- Let the Dapp run its Magic, to load up the contract informaation
- You are good to go, and can carry out your transfers

#### Setup  
- Clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
